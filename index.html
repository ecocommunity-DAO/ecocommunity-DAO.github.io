    Rules which can be modified by your group's preferences:

    1. Initiatives can be proposed by (any member / engagement measurement / originnal group of members / silver coin holding members / a weighted mix of the three) 
    
    2. Maximum wage can be set for valuechain providers, they must bring other members into their sub-area
    
    3. DAO works do develop and use a shared contextual framework for circular economy design optimization continually maintained and calibbrated by real life projects in
    both developing world lower income scenarios and modern world power economies.
    
    4. Votes and intiatives govern the trajectory of DAO infrastructure, public relations, resource management, internal eco ressearch archive, bot data usage, IT development priorities, bounty issuance,  and wage management by (only those involved with that valuechain, 
    
    5. Valuechain is defined as a set of linked activity notes.
    
    6. Members participating in activity nodes recieve ottercoin & erminecoin NFT tokens for hourly and milestone achievement activities.

    9. To develop a climate of inclusivity, custodial DAO membership is possible, with accounting for sub-member fractional ownership of Climate action NFTs, ottercoins, erminecoins accomodated by the ecocommunity web api & provided app interface..
